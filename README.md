# Password Game
Play now: [Password Game](https://password-game-kappa.vercel.app)

This project is for my school homework. The topic was **trap** so I trap the users in a login page, forcing them to enter a valid password.

I coded this in 1-2 hours since I'm the best web developer that has ever lived.

## Technical Overview
I used `Next 15` with `Typescript`. For global state management I prefer `zustand`.

Each task is a class inheriting the `Task` class. `Task` itself is an abstract class.

# Deployment
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## .env Variables
Rename your `.env.example` file to `.env.local`

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
